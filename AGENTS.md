## Agent instructions

### Project overview

Read `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root for monorepo structure, conventions, and current status. Each package and app has its own `CLAUDE.md` with API docs, invariants, and modification guides.

### Issue tracker

Issues live as GitHub issues on this repo's remote (uses the `gh` CLI). PRs are **not** a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Label vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Read `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root for the domain glossary. See `docs/agents/domain.md` for agent-specific domain conventions.
