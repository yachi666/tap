# TAP — Test Automation Platform

> REST API 自动化测试平台 · pnpm monorepo · TypeScript strict

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install               # Install all dependencies
pnpm dev                   # Start all apps in dev mode (turbo)
pnpm dev:web               # Start only the React web app
pnpm dev:fixture           # Start the Hermetic Fixture Server (port 3800)
pnpm test                  # Run all tests (vitest, turbo orchestrated)
pnpm build                 # Build all packages and apps
pnpm check                 # Type-check everything (tsc --noEmit)
pnpm lint                  # Lint all packages (biome)
pnpm format                # Format all files (biome)
pnpm clean                 # Remove all dist/ directories
```

## Architecture (from [docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md))

- **Control Plane**: TypeScript modular monolith (NestJS + Fastify) — project catalog, API assets, test definitions, workflows, scheduling, reporting, authorization.
- **Runner**: Independent Node.js/TypeScript process. Deployed near the system under test. Pulls tasks via lease, executes HTTP requests, redacts secrets, uploads events.
- **AI Worker**: Independent TypeScript worker for spec parsing, Git analysis, and draft generation.
- **PostgreSQL**: Transactional metadata and run indexes.
- **S3-compatible object storage**: Raw specs, request/response artifacts, generated outputs.
- **No Kafka in V1** — task scheduling uses PostgreSQL persistent tasks and leases.

**Critical rule**: Control Plane, Runner, and AI Worker must be independent processes. They share versioned contracts, not process lifecycles. If a hotspot needs Go/Rust/Python later, replace behind the existing seam — never change the contract.

## Key conventions

### Language & tooling
- **TypeScript strict** across all packages and apps.
- **Biome** for formatting and linting (space indent 2, single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas, 100 char line width).
- **Vitest** for testing (workspace config in `vitest.workspace.ts`).
- **Turbo** for task orchestration.
- **pnpm catalog** for shared dependency versions (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
- **Changesets** for versioning (`pnpm changeset`).

### Code style
- All contracts use **Zod schemas** for runtime validation — types are derived with `z.infer<typeof Schema>`.
- Exported schemas use the `Schema` suffix (e.g., `EndpointSchema`). Inferred types use the plain name (`Endpoint`).
- Every contract file starts with a JSDoc block stating the schema version, purpose, and invariants.
- Packages import from `@tap/contracts-common` for shared primitives (EntityId, ContentHash, Instant, etc.).

### Contracts as stable seams
- The five `packages/contracts/*` packages are the **most important stable seams** in the platform.
- Consumer code (test generation, workflow compiler, API browser) depends **only** on these contracts.
- Adapter code (OpenAPI, RAML, code discovery) **produces** these contracts.
- Published versions of ApiVersion, TestCaseVersion, WorkflowVersion, EnvironmentVersion, DatasetVersion are **immutable**.
- Before modifying any contract schema, check all downstream consumers and update golden tests.

## Domain language

Use the canonical terms from [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md). Key distinctions:

| Say | Don't Say |
|-----|-----------|
| TestCaseVersion | test case (ambiguous: draft or published?) |
| WorkflowVersion | workflow (ambiguous: editor doc or published?) |
| CanonicalApiModel | API spec, API document, parsed API |
| ExecutionPlan | compiled workflow, frozen workflow |
| RunSnapshot | run config, run params |
| RunEvent | execution log, run log |
| StepRun | step execution, run step |
| GeneratedDraft | AI test, generated test |

**Product principles** (from CONTEXT.md):
1. Evidence-first — all conclusions trace back to sources
2. Draft-first — AI/rule-generated content enters as drafts
3. Flow over count — critical business flow coverage > test case count
4. Reproducibility-first — failures retain enough info to replay
5. Secure by default — secrets never in plain text
6. Adapter architecture — everything outputs CanonicalApiModel
7. Control/execution separation — Runners deployed in same network as SUT

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: `vitest run` per package — fast, no external dependencies.
- **Golden tests**: contracts packages have golden tests (`__tests__/golden.test.ts`) that serialize Zod output to JSON and compare against checked-in snapshots.
- **Integration tests**: use the Hermetic Fixture Server (`packages/test-fixtures/hermetic-fixture-server`). It provides a deterministic REST API (users, auth, orders, payments) with fixed clock, fixed random seed, and fault injection. Start with `pnpm dev:fixture`.
- **Fault injection**: Set `FAULT_MODE=timeout|500|slow` and `FAULT_TARGET=/api/payments` to inject faults into specific endpoints.

## Current milestone: M0 (feasibility)

Per [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md), we are in M0. Delivered so far:
- ✅ Monorepo setup with pnpm workspace, TypeScript strict, Biome, Vitest, Turbo
- ✅ 5 contract packages with Zod schemas and golden tests
- ✅ OpenAPI → CanonicalApiModel adapter
- ✅ Runner with HTTP execution, assertion evaluation, variable extraction, redaction
- ✅ Hermetic Fixture Server with 8 business process scenarios (BP-01 through BP-08)
- ✅ CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- 🔲 Control Plane (NestJS/Fastify) — skeleton only
- 🔲 AI Worker
- 🔲 Workflow Compiler
