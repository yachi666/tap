## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install               # Install all dependencies
pnpm dev                   # Start all apps in dev mode (turbo)
pnpm dev:web               # Start only the React web app (port 5173)
pnpm dev:cp                # Start only the Control Plane (port 3802, needs PostgreSQL)
pnpm dev:runner            # Start only the Runner
pnpm dev:fixture           # Start the Hermetic Fixture Server (port 3800)
pnpm test                  # Run all tests (vitest, turbo orchestrated)
pnpm build                 # Build all packages and apps
pnpm check                 # Type-check everything (tsc --noEmit)
pnpm lint                  # Lint all packages (biome)
pnpm format                # Format all files (biome)
pnpm clean                 # Remove all dist/ directories
```

## Architecture (from [docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md))

- **Control Plane**: Fastify API server — workspace/project management, API import, test authoring, workflow compilation, run orchestration, scheduling, reporting, IAM with JWT auth.
- **Runner**: Independent Node.js/TypeScript process. Deployed near the system under test. Pulls tasks via lease, executes HTTP requests, redacts secrets, uploads events.
- **AI Worker**: Planned for M3 — spec parsing, Git analysis, and draft generation.
- **PostgreSQL**: Transactional metadata and run indexes. 22 tables covering M0–M2 schema.
- **S3-compatible object storage**: Raw specs, request/response artifacts, generated outputs (not yet integrated).
- **No Kafka in V1** — task scheduling uses PostgreSQL persistent tasks and leases.

**Critical rule**: Control Plane, Runner, and AI Worker must be independent processes. They share versioned contracts, not process lifecycles. If a hotspot needs Go/Rust/Python later, replace behind the existing seam — never change the contract.

## Key conventions

### Language & tooling
- **TypeScript strict** across all packages and apps.
- **Biome** for formatting and linting (space indent 2, single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas, 100 char line width).
- **Vitest** for testing (workspace config in `vitest.workspace.ts`).
- **Turbo** for task orchestration.
- **pnpm catalog** for shared dependency versions (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
- **Changesets** for versioning (`pnpm changeset`).

### Code style
- All contracts use **Zod schemas** for runtime validation — types are derived with `z.infer<typeof Schema>`.
- Exported schemas use the `Schema` suffix (e.g., `EndpointSchema`). Inferred types use the plain name (`Endpoint`).
- Every contract file starts with a JSDoc block stating the schema version, purpose, and invariants.
- Packages import from `@sketch-test/contracts-common` for shared primitives (EntityId, ContentHash, Instant, etc.).

### Contracts as stable seams
- The five `packages/contracts/*` packages are the **most important stable seams** in the platform.
- Consumer code (test generation, workflow compiler, API browser) depends **only** on these contracts.
- Adapter code (OpenAPI, RAML, code discovery) **produces** these contracts.
- Published versions of ApiVersion, TestCaseVersion, WorkflowVersion, EnvironmentVersion, DatasetVersion are **immutable**.
- Before modifying any contract schema, check all downstream consumers and update golden tests.

## Domain language

Use the canonical terms and product principles from [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md). Key reminders:

- Published versions (ApiVersion, TestCaseVersion, WorkflowVersion, EnvironmentVersion, DatasetVersion) are **immutable**.
- The seven product principles are non-negotiable — evidence-first, draft-first, flow over count, reproducibility-first, secure by default, adapter architecture, control/execution separation.

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: `vitest run` per package — fast, no external dependencies.
- **Golden tests**: all 5 contract packages have golden tests that serialize Zod output to JSON and compare against checked-in snapshots.
- **Adapter tests**: each adapter (OpenAPI, Postman, HAR, RAML, format-detector) has fixture-based tests.
- **Integration tests**: use the Hermetic Fixture Server (`packages/test-fixtures/hermetic-fixture-server`). It provides a deterministic REST API (users, auth, orders, payments) with fixed clock, fixed random seed, and fault injection. Start with `pnpm dev:fixture`.
- **Fault injection**: Set `FAULT_MODE=timeout|500|slow` and `FAULT_TARGET=/api/payments` to inject faults into specific endpoints.
- **Control Plane and Web app** do not yet have automated tests — this is a known gap.

## Current status

M0 (feasibility) is complete. M1 and M2 features are in active development. Key modules built:

- ✅ Monorepo setup with pnpm workspace, TypeScript strict, Biome, Vitest, Turbo
- ✅ 5 contract packages with Zod schemas and golden tests
- ✅ 5 adapters: OpenAPI, Postman, HAR, RAML, format-detector
- ✅ Runner with HTTP execution, assertion evaluation, variable extraction, redaction
- ✅ Hermetic Fixture Server with 8 business process scenarios (BP-01 through BP-08)
- ✅ CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- ✅ Control Plane: 14 modules, ~80 API endpoints, 22 database tables (M0–M2 schema)
- ✅ Workflow Compiler (677 lines) — compiles WorkflowDefinitions into ExecutionPlans
- ✅ Web app: 10 pages, 7 Zustand stores, connected to Control Plane
- ✅ CLI tool with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI examples
- 🔲 Control Plane and Web automated tests
- 🔲 AI Worker
- 🔲 S3 object storage integration
